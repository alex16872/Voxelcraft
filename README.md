# Voxelcraft
An experiment to produce a minecraft like game in webGL and JavaScript.

## Why?

I've been a big fan of minecraft since I first discovered it ( sometime during the alpha ) and it's a game I've come back to many times. Although I tired of vanilla after a couple of years I was brought back by modded minecraft, and the huge amount of variety it offers. I've regularly revisted it every year or so since, to try the newest mods around. Recently I've started playing vanilla again, after the release of the "better together" update. While I loved the fact I could now play with my friends who don't own ultra gaming rigs I found things that definitely soured the experience for me. The weird mismatchs between how things behave compared to the Java edition and the lack of modding.

Coming back to this project, this isn't just an attempt to create minecraft 2.0. It's not meant to compete, and I don't intend to ever monitize it. I wanted to make a 3D game to development my webGL abilities, and this was the sort of game I wanted to try. It has fun challenges and I know the structure of the game quite well. Also I'd like to explore what new things I can try, to make this a truly unique project. Although it will likely always be known as a "minecraft clone".
